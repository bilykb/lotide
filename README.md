## **What is Lotide?**
---

>Lotide is  a clone of the lodash JavaScript library to practice creating various types of functions using JavaScript.

---
## **Summary**
---

>This repository contains all the functions created over the course of the Lotide project while studying at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/). Functions will be organized by the week of learning in which they were created, and referred to in order of creation.

### <a name="week1">Week 1 Functions:</a>
 [assertEqual.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/assertEqual.js)
* A function which accepts two primitive data types as arguments: actual outcome and expected result. The function then prints to console whether the outcome matches the expected result with an assertion statement

[head.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/head.js)
* a function which accepts an array as an argument, and returns the head of the array
  
[tail.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/tail.js)
* a function which accepts an array as an argument, and returns the tail of the array

[eqArrays.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/eqArrays.js)
* a function which compares two arrays to determine if they are similar in elements and length
  
[assertArraysEqual.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/assertArraysEqual.js)
* a function which utilizes aqArrays.js to compare two arrays for an exact match, then prints to console a pass or fail assertion
  
[without.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/without.js)
* a function that accepts two arrays: the source array, and an "itemsToRemove" array.  It returns a new array with the items removed.

[flatten.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/flatten.js)
* a function that accepts a nested array with one level of nesting as an argument, and returns a single "flattened" array

### <a name="week2">Week 2 Functions:</a>

[middle.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/middle.js)
 * A function that accepts an array, and returns the middle index value(s) in a new array

[countOnly.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/countOnly.js)
* a function that accepts an array of names, and an object of names you wish to make a tally of.  Returns a new object with a name count

[countLetters.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/countLetters.js)
* a function that accepts a string of characters.  It then returns an object with a tally of characters

[letterPositions.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/letterPositions.js)
* a function that accepts a string of characters.  It then returns an object with an array for each character present

[findByKeyValue.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/findByKeyValue.js)
 * a function an searches for a key on an object where its value matches a given value

[eqObjects.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/eqObjects.js)
* a function which compares two objects to see if they are similar

[assertObjectsEqual.js]()
 * function which takes two parameters, the actual object, and the expected object, and returns an assertion passed or failed
