### <a name="week1">Week 1:</a>
 1. [assertEqual.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/assertEqual.js)
    * A function which accepts two primitive data types as arguments: actual outcome and expected result. The function then prints to console whether the outcome matches the expected result with an assertion statement

  2. [head.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/head.js)
      * a function which accepts an array as an argument, and returns the head of the array
  
  3. [tail.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/tail.js)
      * a function which accepts an array as an argument, and returns the tail of the array

  4. [eqArrays.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/eqArrays.js)
      * a function which compares two arrays to determine if they are similar in elements and length
  
  5. [assertArraysEqual.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/assertArraysEqual.js)
      * a function which utilizes aqArrays.js to compare two arrays for an exact match, then prints to console a pass or fail assertion
  
  6. [without.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/without.js)
      * a function that accepts two arrays: the source array, and an "itemsToRemove" array.  It returns a new array with the items removed.

  7. [flatten.js](https://github.com/bilykb/lotide/blob/master/flatten.js)
      * a function that accepts a nested as an argument array with one level of nesting, and returns a single "flattened" array
